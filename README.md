# Sokoban Puzzle Game – Java Development Project

This is a classic Sokoban puzzle game built in Java, where the player pushes crates onto target positions across multiple levels.

## Features
- Grid-based movement and interactive crate mechanics
- Multiple progressively challenging levels
- Player and crate sprites with custom rendering
- Demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:
  - **Encapsulation** – private fields with getters/setters
  - **Abstraction** – simplified methods to interact with game objects
  - **Inheritance** – `Player` and `Crate` extend `GameObject`
  - **Polymorphism** – different game objects implement the same `Movable` interface
- Java Swing-based GUI for smooth rendering
